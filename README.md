I created a school project, "Students Personal Management Systemâ€”Web Application", offering tailored features for students. Its dashboard, designed with care, hosts various functionalities. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap for the front-end and PHP, XAMPP for the back-end, it guarantees a seamless user experience.
