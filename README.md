# Database driven Website
I created a school project, "Students Personal Management System—Web Application" as one of my university's project, offering tailored features for students. It's a dashboard, designed with care, hosts various functionalities. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap for the front-end and PHP, XAMPP for the back-end, it guarantees a seamless user experience.

## Installation

Install my-project by downloading all the files. Create a folder named" project" and place "project folder" inside “htdocs” folder. Launch all the files containing code in VSCode.
Once all the files are displayed in VSCode, launch xampp and start Apache + MySQL. Now open the browser and type “localhost/project”. Make sure the "project-folder" is placed inside htdocs folder so that it may open in browser. After opening localhost/project you will see multiple files in your browser. 

Other details are mentioned in code. 
Flow of the whole web application is as followed:
Login.html (linked with logincon.php and stylelogin.css)
Signup.html (linked with connect.php and style2.css)
Dashboard.html (linked with style3.css and login.html) It also contains JavaScript.
